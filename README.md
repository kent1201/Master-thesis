# TimeGAN with different loss functions
**This is a PyTorch implementation of the TimeGAN in "[Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Abstract.html)" (Jinsung Yoon, Daniel Jarrett, Mihaela van der Schaar, NIPS, 2019). We also add different loss functions to try the best performance of the frame work.**
**My master-thesis is at the master branch.**
